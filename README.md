I developed a dynamic Zomato dashboard leveraging a Kaggle dataset, featuring interactive visualizations for city and user analysis. The dashboard showcases detailed insights into restaurant trends across different cities, including ratings distribution, cuisine popularity, and cost analysis. Users can explore trends by adjusting filters such as city, cuisine type, and user preferences, enabling deeper exploration into dining habits and preferences. This interactive tool not only enhances decision-making for restaurant owners and marketers but also provides valuable insights for food enthusiasts and researchers studying consumer behavior in the dining industry.
